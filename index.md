> Imagine a place where you can hear the river running over the rocks and area is so unspoilt that the air itself is almost blue. Where nearby rainforest surrounds you with the quiet secrets that makes you wonder what lies beyond. Or the streams and waterfalls so clear that you can look into the world below it.

The Allyn Riverside Cabins are for those seeking seclusion and a chance to get away from all the hustle, located near the World Heritage Listed - Barrington Tops

Situated on 125 acres the cabins offer you the complete getaway.  Enjoy a walk up the back of the property for magnificent views over the Allyn River Valley. Or do a little exploring through the old growth rainforest. Or just sit beside the Allyn River and watch it flow.


Enjoy an evening around the campfire on a chilly winter evening or pack a picnic and go adventuring.
In summer the river is superb for swimming, with a couple of private swimming holes or head up to the 
State forest for the famous Ladies Well, which is a series of small waterfalls.


We love this place and have put our heart into it
We hope that you will enjoy your stay and leave the place feeling relaxed and refreshed.

Please note: There is no mobile phone reception (however if you have Telstra you can walk up the hill behind for reception) No TV - so you can actually talk each other.  We also recommend you have either a 4WD or AWD due to 12km of unsealed road and a small river crossing.
