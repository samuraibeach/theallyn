## Welcome

> Imagine a place where the mountain grandeur is so unspoilt that the air itself is almost   blue Where adjacent rainforest surrounds you with the quiet secret magic that makes the expectation of mythical characters seem quite rational. Or the streams and waterfalls so clear that the word crystal seems inadequate.



Enjoy an evening around the campfire or pack a picnic and go adventuring. In summer the
river is superb for swimming, with a couple of private swimming holes or head up to the 
State forest for the famous Ladies Well, which is a series of small waterfalls.
We love this place and have put our heart into it
We hope that you will enjoy your stay and leave the place feeling relaxed and refreshed.

The Allyn Riverside Cabins offers it’s guests a stress free getaway in the World
Heritage Listed Barrington Tops.

Located 35km north of East Gresford, once you arrive it is time to sit back on the balcony and watch the river go by or observe the abundant birdlife. Take a walk up through our own private rainforest full of elkhorns, staghorns and awesome gum trees. Continue up to the top for magnificent views of the Barrington Tops and the chance of spotting kangaroos and deer. If you are into bushwalking or 4 wheel driving the State Forest and Barrington Tops National Park is just 3 kms away.
