    <h4>The Allyn Riverside Cabins</h4>
    3486 Allyn River Road, Upper Allyn, <br>
    New South Wales 2311, Australia
</div>

Please note â€“ You will be driving on 12km of dirt road to reach us, also our track down to the cabin can become slippery in wet weather. It is recommended that you have a AWD vehicle or 4WD.


If not, just check with us regarding road conditions the night before arrival.

There are no restaurants near by so you will need to bring all your own food supplies. There is a general store in East Gresford, for your last minute purchases.


There are no televisions and no phone service. Although for those who need a telephone a public phone is located at the entrance to the State Forest. Or you can walk up the hill behind the cabins. There is a nice track and you can get 4 bars with Telstra, even check email if really necessary.
